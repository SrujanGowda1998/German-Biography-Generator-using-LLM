# German-Biography-Generator-using-LLM
In this project I'm implementing a system which can take in German text of any length, in a MS word file format and gives out a one page summary which can be downloaded. I have used the large language model (LLM) for summarization(mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2). This product can also work as an excellent German text summarization engine with a very minimal modification in the main file.
