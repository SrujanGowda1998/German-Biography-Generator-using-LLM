# German-Biography-Generator-using-LLM
In this project, I have implemented a system which can take in German text of "any length", in an MS word file format and gives out a one page Biography which can be downloaded. I have used a large language model (LLM) for generating biography(mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2). This product can also work as an excellent German text summarization engine with a very minimal modification in the python script. The app can be accessed for free using the following URL.
